#### Notes
This folder contains `.h` and corresponding library files for data structures. To include them in your program,
Either save the libs in `/usr/lib` and the header files in `/usr/include' or have them locally in your source program directory.

Then use the following to compile the file:
```
gcc <sourceFile.c> -L<path/to/libraryFile> -l<libraryName(without lib prefix)>
```
